A Mac OS X port of the popular 68K Assembler/Simulator, EASy68K. Port is being done as my CSS 497 Capstone project as part of my Computing & Software Systems degree at the University of Washington: Bothell campus. 

EASy68K can be downloaded from: http://www.easy68k.com

Some quick notes:

The editor is not fully featured as far as a text editor. There is currently no syntax coloring, or quick comment/uncomment buttons.

The editor assembler options are all implemented, but the template/editor options preference tabs are not. There is little GUI feedback with regard to errors in your assembly sent

The editor has little GUI feedback in the way of errors. For now, you'll have to open Console.app (located in /Applications/Utilities/) to see what kind of errors you have.

Assembling the file will put the listfile and s-record in the same directory and won't give any indication of success. You'll have to manually open Sim68K and open an s-record file.

The simulator buttons are not disabled if a program is not running, but they should disable if you hit "run" and are having a continuously branching program (all except the "pause" button).

The "run to line" button is not implemented.

Error output in the Simulator is now output in the window. Memory browser and I/O are now implemented. Only use scrollbar in the active memory window, and editing the memory window does nothing (should be disabled, but i might have forgot). There are scrolling issues if you try to use your scroll wheel or multi-touch scroll to scroll the address or ASCII contents area, so for now, avoid scrolling that way :)

All other features aren't yet implemented either, but are on the list :)
